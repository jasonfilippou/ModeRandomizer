###Mode Randomizer

A very simple Python script that randomizes all possible
(Mode, Key, String-Crossing) triplets for the 4-string bass guitar
to provide the user with a randomized challenge to test their command of 
musical modes.

Very easy to switch to extended range bass guitar, standard 6-string guitar,
and any other stringed instruments where playing modes across different string crossings
is something that makes sense.
